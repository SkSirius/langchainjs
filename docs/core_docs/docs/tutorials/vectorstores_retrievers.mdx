# Vector stores and retrievers

This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain's vector store and retriever abstractions.
These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data-- from (vector) databases and other sources-- for integration with LLM workflows.
They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG (see our RAG tutorial [here](../../docs/tutorials/rag)).

## Concepts

This guide focuses on retrieval of text data. We will cover the following concepts:

- Documents;
- Vector stores;
- Retrievers;

## Setup

### Installation

This tutorial requires the `langchain`, `@langchain/core`, and `@langchain/community` packages:

```mdx-code-block
import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Npm2Yarn>
  langchain @langchain/core @langchain/community
</Npm2Yarn>
```

For more details, see our [Installation
guide](../../docs/how_to/installation/).

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment
variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..."

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
```

## Documents

LangChain implements a [Document](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata.
It has two attributes:

- `pageContent`: a string representing the content;
- `metadata`: an object containing arbitrary data;

The `metadata` attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information.
Note that an individual `Document` object often represents a chunk of a larger document.

Let's generate some sample documents:

```typescript
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

export default [
  new Document({
    pageContent:
      "Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.",
    metadata: { source: "mammal-pets-doc" },
  }),
  new Document({
    pageContent: "Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.",
    metadata: { source: "mammal-pets-doc" },
  }),
  new Document({
    pageContent:
      "Goldfish are popular pets for beginners, requiring relatively simple care.",
    metadata: { source: "fish-pets-doc" },
  }),
  new Document({
    pageContent:
      "Parrots are intelligent birds capable of mimicking human speech.",
    metadata: { source: "bird-pets-doc" },
  }),
  new Document({
    pageContent:
      "Rabbits are social animals that need plenty of space to hop around.",
    metadata: { source: "mammal-pets-doc" },
  }),
];
```

**API Reference:** [Document](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html)

Here we've generated five documents, containing metadata indicating three distinct "sources".

## Vector stores

Vector search is a common way to store and search over unstructured data (such as unstructured text).
The idea is to store numeric vectors that are associated with the text. Given a query, we can [embed](../../docs/concepts/embedding_models) it as a vector of the same dimension and use vector similarity metrics to identify related data in the store.

LangChain [VectorStore](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html) objects contain methods for adding text and Document objects to the store, and querying them using various similarity metrics.
They are often initialized with [embedding](../../docs/how_to/embed_text) models, which determine how text data is translated to numeric vectors.

LangChain includes a suite of [integrations](../../docs/integrations/vectorstores) with different vector store technologies.
Some vector stores are hosted by a provider (e.g., various cloud providers) and require specific credentials to use; some (such as [Postgres](../../docs/integrations/vectorstores/pgvector)) run in separate infrastructure that can be run locally or via a third-party; others can run in-memory for lightweight workloads.
Here we will demonstrate usage of LangChain VectorStores using [Chroma](../../docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma), which includes an in-memory implementation.

To instantiate a vector store, we often need to provide an [embedding](../../docs/how_to/embed_text) model to specify how text should be converted into a numeric vector. Here we will use [OpenAI embeddings](../../docs/integrations/text_embedding/openai).

```typescript
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { Chroma } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/chroma";
import documents from "../data/documents";

  const chromaConfig = {
    url: "https://localhost:8000"
    collectionName: "pets_collection",
  };

  const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings()

  const chroma = await Chroma.fromDocuments(documents, embeddings, chromaConfig);
```

**API Reference:** [OpenAIEmbeddings](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_openai.OpenAIEmbeddings.html)

---

Calling `.fromDocuments` here will add the documents to the vector store. [VectorStore](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html) implements methods for adding documents that can also be called after the object is instantiated.
Most implementations will allow you to connect to an existing vector store-- e.g., by providing a client, index name, or other information. See the documentation for a specific [integration](../../docs/concepts/vectorstores) for more detail.

Once we've instantiated a `VectorStore` that contains documents, we can query it. [VectorStore](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html) includes methods for querying:

- Synchronously and asynchronously;
- By string query and by vector;
- With and without returning similarity scores;
- By similarity and [maximum marginal relevance](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html#maxMarginalRelevanceSearch) (to balance similarity with query to diversity in retrieved results).

The methods will generally include a list of [Document](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.documents.Document.html) objects in their outputs.

### Examples

Return documents based on similarity to a string query:

```typescript
await chroma.similaritySearch("cat");
```

```json
[
  {
    "pageContent": "Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.",
    "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
  },
  {
    "pageContent": "Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.",
    "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
  },
  {
    "pageContent": "Rabbits are social animals that need plenty of space to hop around.",
    "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
  },
  {
    "pageContent": "Parrots are intelligent birds capable of mimicking human speech.",
    "metadata": { "source": "bird-pets-doc" }
  }
]
```

Return scores:

```typescript
await chroma.similaritySearchWithScore("cat");
```

```json
// Note that providers implement different scores; Chroma here
// returns a distance metric that should vary inversely with
// similarity.

[
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.",
      "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.3749317423763067
  ],
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.",
      "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.483024756734972
  ],
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Rabbits are social animals that need plenty of space to hop around.",
      "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.4958319828348823
  ],
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Parrots are intelligent birds capable of mimicking human speech.",
      "metadata": { "source": "bird-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.497523653562735
  ]
]
```

Return documents based on similarity to an embedded query:

```typescript
const embedding = await new OpenAIEmbeddings().embedQuery("cat");
const k = 1; // number of similar vectors to return

await chroma.similaritySearchVectorWithScore(embedding, k);
```

```json
[
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.",
      "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.3749317423763067
  ],
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.",
      "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.483024756734972
  ],
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Rabbits are social animals that need plenty of space to hop around.",
      "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.4958319828348823
  ],
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Parrots are intelligent birds capable of mimicking human speech.",
      "metadata": { "source": "bird-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.497523653562735
  ],
  [
    {
      "pageContent": "Goldfish are popular pets for beginners, requiring relatively simple care.",
      "metadata": { "source": "fish-pets-doc" }
    },
    0.5030592849950544
  ]
]
```

## Retrievers

LangChain `VectorStore` objects do not subclass [Runnable](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html), and so cannot immediately be integrated into LangChain Expression Language [chains](../..//docs/concepts/lcel).

LangChain [Retrievers](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/modules/_langchain_core.retrievers.html) are Runnables, so they implement a standard set of methods (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous `invoke` and `batch` operations) and are designed to be incorporated in LCEL chains.

We can create a simple version of this ourselves, without subclassing `Retriever`.
If we choose what method we wish to use to retrieve documents, we can create a runnable easily.
Below we will build one around the `similaritySearch` method:

```typescript
const retriever = RunnableLambda.from(({ query, k }) =>
  chroma.similaritySearch(query, k)
);

await retriever.invoke({ query: "cat", k: 1 });
```

**API Reference:** [RunnableLambda](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableLambda.html)

---

```json
[
  {
    "pageContent": "Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.",
    "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
  }
]
```

Vectorstores implement an `asRetriever` method that will generate a Retriever, specifically a [VectorStoreRetriever](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStoreRetriever.html).
These retrievers include specific `search_type` and `search_kwargs` (only for maximum marginal relevance `mmr` search type) attributes that identify what methods of the underlying vector store to call, and how to parameterize them.
For instance, we can replicate the above with the following:

```typescript
const retriever = chroma.asRetriever({ searchType: "similarity", k: 1 });
await retriever.invoke("cat");
```

```json
[
  {
    "pageContent": "Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.",
    "metadata": { "source": "mammal-pets-doc" }
  }
]
```

`VectorStoreRetriever` supports search types of `"similarity"` (default) and `"mmr"` (maximum marginal relevance, described above).

Retrievers can easily be incorporated into more complex applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications that combine a given question with retrieved context into a prompt for a LLM. Below we show a minimal example.

```mdx-code-block
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />
```

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import {
  RunnablePassthrough,
  RunnableSequence,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";

const chatPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`
  Answer this question using the provided context only.
  Question: {question}
  Context: {context}
`);

const ragChain = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    context: retriever,
    question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  },
  chatPrompt,
  llm,
  new StringOutputParser(),
]);

const result = await ragChain.invoke("tell me about cats");
console.log(result);
```

**API Reference:** [ChatPromptTemplate](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.prompts.ChatPromptTemplate.html) | [RunnablePassthrough](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnablePassthrough.html) | [RunnableSequence](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableSequence.html)

Retrieval strategies can be rich and complex. For example:

- We can [infer hard rules and filters](../../docs/how_to/self_query) from a query (e.g., "using documents published after 2020");
- We can [return documents that are linked](../../docs/how_to/parent_document_retriever) to the retrieved context in some way (e.g., via some document taxonomy);
- We can generate [multiple embeddings](../../docs/how_to/multi_vector) for each unit of context;
- We can [ensemble results](../../docs/how_to/ensemble_retriever) from multiple retrievers;
- We can assign weights to documents, e.g., to weigh [recent documents](../../docs/how_to/time_weighted_vectorstore) higher.

The [retrievers](../../docs/how_to/#retrievers) section of the how-to guides covers these and other built-in retrieval strategies.

It is also straightforward to extend the [BaseRetriever](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.retrievers.BaseRetriever.html) class in order to implement custom retrievers.
See our how-to guide [here](../../docs/how_to/custom_retriever).
